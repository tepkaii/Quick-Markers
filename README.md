# Quick Markers

A simple VS Code extension that lets you mark files and folders with emoji badges for quick visual identification in the file explorer.

## Features

Mark any file or folder with one of four emoji badges:

- üî• Fire - for hot/important files
- ‚ö° Zap - for quick access items
- üöÄ Rocket - for project launches or priorities
- üëÅÔ∏è Eye - for items to watch or review

Right-click on any file or folder in the explorer and select from the marking options. Click the same mark again to remove it, or use "Clear Mark" to remove any existing mark.

Marks are stored per workspace in `.vscode/marked-files.json` and persist across VS Code sessions.

2. Select "Mark as [emoji]" from the context menu
